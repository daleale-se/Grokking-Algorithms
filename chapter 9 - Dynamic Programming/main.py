# Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid
# Each cell is a sub-problem, so think about how you can divide your problem into sub-problems.
# Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint
# You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete sub-problems,
# and they don’t depend on each other.
